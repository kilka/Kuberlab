- Direct internet egress
- No hub/spoke topology

---

## Best Practice Alignment Analysis

### ✅ **STRONG ALIGNMENT**

#### 1. Segmentation Strategy
| **Best Practice** | **Our Implementation** | **Alignment** |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Separate subnets by function | ✅ AKS nodes, AGC load balancer in dedicated subnets | **STRONG** |
| Trust boundaries = subnet boundaries | ✅ NSG policies align with subnet purposes | **STRONG** |
| Avoid mixing security levels | ✅ Web tier (AGC) separate from app tier (AKS) | **STRONG** |

**What we do well:**
```hcl
# Clear functional separation
resource "azurerm_subnet" "aks" {
  address_prefixes = ["10.0.1.0/24"]  # App tier
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "agc" {  
  address_prefixes = ["10.0.2.0/24"]  # Web tier
  delegation {
    name = "Microsoft.ServiceNetworking/trafficControllers"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Addressing & Subnet Sizing
| **Best Practice** | **Our Implementation** | **Alignment** |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Large, non-overlapping blocks | ✅ 10.0.0.0/16 per region | **STRONG** |
| 30-40% headroom for growth | ✅ Using only 2/256 possible /24 subnets | **STRONG** |
| /24 for app/web tiers | ✅ Both subnets sized at /24 | **STRONG** |

**What we do well:**
- Conservative addressing leaves massive room for growth
- Proper subnet sizing for container workloads
- Non-overlapping RFC1918 space

#### 3. Container (AKS) IP Planning
| **Best Practice** | **Our Implementation** | **Alignment** |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Azure CNI Overlay recommended | ⚠️ Using classic Azure CNI | **PARTIAL** |
| Proper subnet sizing for nodes | ✅ /24 adequate for node scaling | **STRONG** |
| Separate node pools in own subnets | ✅ Single subnet but properly sized | **STRONG** |

**What we do well:**
- Adequate subnet sizing for Azure CNI
- Room for multiple node pools
- Proper NAT Gateway planning (ready to implement)

### ⚠️ **PARTIAL ALIGNMENT**

#### 4. Control Planes & Egress
| **Best Practice** | **Our Implementation** | **Gap** |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Centralized egress via Azure Firewall | ❌ Direct internet egress | **MAJOR** |
| UDR routing through hub | ❌ No hub topology | **MAJOR** |
| Private Link for PaaS services | ✅ Using managed identity (better) | **STRONG** |
| NAT Gateway for SNAT scaling | ❌ Not implemented | **MINOR** |

#### 5. Security Boundaries  
| **Best Practice** | **Our Implementation** | **Gap** |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| NSGs at subnet level | ✅ Properly implemented | **STRONG** |
| Default deny inbound | ✅ Implemented | **STRONG** |
| DDoS Network Protection | ❌ Not enabled | **MINOR** |
| Firewall Policy hierarchical | ❌ No firewall | **MAJOR** |
| Zero-trust with Calico | ✅ Implemented via Flux | **STRONG** |

### ❌ **GAPS FOR ENTERPRISE**

#### 6. Hub-and-Spoke Architecture
| **Best Practice** | **Current Gap** | **Impact** |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Hub VNet per region | No hub topology | High - No centralized services |
| Connectivity/shared services | No central firewall, DNS, Bastion | High - Management overhead |
| Spoke per workload domain | Single VNet for everything | Medium - Blast radius |

#### 7. Enterprise Connectivity
| **Best Practice** | **Current Gap** | **Impact** |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| ExpressRoute + VPN failover | No on-prem connectivity | Medium - Demo limitation |
| VNet peering patterns | No hub peering | High - No central governance |
| BGP communities/route filters | Not applicable without ER | Low - Demo context |

## Detailed Gap Analysis

### **CRITICAL GAPS** (Production Blockers)

#### 1. No Central Egress Control
**Current State:**
```hcl
# Direct internet access from AKS subnet
security_rule {
  name = "AllowInternetOutbound"
  destination_address_prefix = "Internet"
}
```

**Best Practice Requirement:**
- All egress through Azure Firewall in hub
- FQDN filtering for outbound connections
- Threat intelligence integration
- Centralized logging and monitoring

#### 2. Missing Hub Infrastructure
**What's Missing:**
- Central firewall for east-west and north-south inspection
- Shared Bastion for secure management access  
- Central DNS forwarders for hybrid scenarios
- Shared monitoring and log aggregation

#### 3. No Advanced Threat Protection
**Current State:** Basic NSG rules only
**Missing Components:**
- Azure Firewall with threat intelligence
- DDoS Network Protection
- Azure Defender for containers
- Network flow analysis

### **IMPORTANT GAPS** (Scalability Limiters)

#### 4. Single VNet Design
**Current Limitation:**
- All workloads in same network boundary
- Shared fate for all applications
- Limited policy granularity
- No environment separation

**Enterprise Requirement:**
```
Hub VNet (10.100.0.0/22)
├── AzureFirewallSubnet (/26)
├── AzureBastionSubnet (/27)  
├── GatewaySubnet (/27)
└── shared-dns (/27)

Spoke VNets:
├── ocr-prod-eastus (10.101.0.0/16)
├── ocr-dev-eastus (10.102.0.0/16)
└── shared-services (10.103.0.0/16)
```

#### 5. Limited Subnet Segmentation  
**Current State:** 2 subnets (web, app)
**Missing Tiers:**
- `privatelink` subnet for Private Endpoints
- `mgmt` subnet for monitoring/agents
- `data` subnet for caches/databases (future)
- `integration` subnet for service brokers

### **MINOR GAPS** (Optimization Opportunities)

#### 6. Azure CNI Classic vs Overlay
**Current:** Classic CNI consuming VNet IPs for pods
**Recommended:** CNI Overlay for IP efficiency
**Impact:** Low for demo, medium for large-scale production

#### 7. No NAT Gateway
**Current:** Potential SNAT port exhaustion under load
**Missing:** Dedicated NAT Gateway for predictable egress
**Impact:** Low for demo, high for production scale

  "ocr-mgmt"           = "10.101.8.192/26" # Monitoring agents - 64 IPs
}
```

### **Phase 2: Security Enhancement**

#### Central Firewall Policy
```hcl
resource "azurerm_firewall_policy" "enterprise" {
  threat_intelligence_mode = "Alert"
  
  # Hierarchical rules
  application_rule_collection {
    name     = "ocr-outbound-allow"
    priority = 1000
    action   = "Allow"
    
    rule {
      name = "container-registries"
      source_addresses = ["10.101.2.0/24"]
      target_fqdns = [
        "*.azurecr.io",
        "mcr.microsoft.com", 
        "*.docker.io"
      ]
      protocols {
        type = "Https"
        port = 443
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Enhanced NSG Rules
```hcl
# Zero-trust baseline
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "ocr_app" {
  # Default deny all inbound
  security_rule {
    name                       = "DenyAllInbound"
    priority                   = 4096
    direction                  = "Inbound"
    access                     = "Deny"
    protocol                   = "*"
    source_port_range          = "*"
    destination_port_range     = "*"
    source_address_prefix      = "*"
    destination_address_prefix = "*"
  }
  
  # Explicit allow from AGC subnet only
  security_rule {
    name                       = "AllowAGCInbound"
    priority                   = 100
    direction                  = "Inbound"
    access                     = "Allow"
    protocol                   = "Tcp"
    source_address_prefix      = "10.101.1.0/24"
    destination_address_prefix = "10.101.2.0/24"
    destination_port_ranges    = ["8000"]
  }
}
```

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**

#### Private Link Integration
```hcl
# Dedicated subnet for all Private Endpoints  
resource "azurerm_subnet" "privatelink" {
  address_prefixes = ["10.101.8.64/26"]
}

# Private endpoints for all PaaS services
resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "keyvault" {
  subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.privatelink.id
  
  private_service_connection {
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_key_vault.main.id
    subresource_names              = ["vault"]
  }
}
```

#### NAT Gateway for Predictable Egress
```hcl
resource "azurerm_nat_gateway" "ocr_egress" {
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  sku_name           = "Standard"
}

resource "azurerm_subnet_nat_gateway_association" "aks" {
  subnet_id      = azurerm_subnet.aks.id
  nat_gateway_id = azurerm_nat_gateway.ocr_egress.id
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### **Option 1: Parallel Deployment** (Recommended)
1. Deploy new hub-and-spoke alongside existing
2. Migrate workloads with blue/green approach  
3. Validate functionality and performance
4. Decomission old single-VNet architecture

### **Option 2: In-Place Evolution** 
1. Add hub VNet and peer to existing spoke
2. Introduce firewall with bypass rules initially
3. Gradually migrate egress traffic through firewall
4. Add additional spokes for new workloads

### **Option 3: Green-Field Rebuild**
1. Deploy complete enterprise architecture
2. Export application data/state
3. Redeploy applications to new architecture
4. DNS cutover for minimal downtime
